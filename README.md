Do you dream of having a contribution graph as epic as a dense forest? 🌲🌲 Then `git-flex` is here to pump up your contributions! This repo includes a workout program that automates your contributions to flex those green squares on your GitHub profile. 💚💪

## What’s the Deal? 🤔

This repo is like a personal trainer for your GitHub activity. If you head over to the [gym](./gym), you’ll find our [lifts](./gym/lifts.txt) counter. Every time you workout, you’re lifting those numbers and making your contribution graph swole. 💪📈

### Warning: Don’t Skip Leg Day (or the Reality Check) 🚨

Jokes aside, I don’t actually recommend using this repo to artificially inflate your contributions. It’s like letting a bot do your push-ups: it looks good, but doesn’t make you any stronger. 💁‍♂️ Instead, let this be a reminder to value genuine effort and real contributions over flashy numbers. 🚀✨

## 🚀 Usage

Check out the [Makefile](./Makefile) to set up your own Git gym. 🏋️‍♀️ Just run:

```shell
make help
```

to see all the available commands and get started.

### ⚙️ Installation

Ready to start your Git fitness journey? Here’s how:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:klepp0/git-flex.git
cd git-flex
make setup
```

This will clone the repo, navigate to it, and set up a crontab job that makes your GitHub profile workout every hour. ⏰

### 🏋️ Just Lift!

Feel like doing some manual labor? You can run:

```shell
make workout
```

in the project directory to manually pump up those contributions. 💪
